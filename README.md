# NOTE!!!
Important!
I modified this so no one could access your credentials anymore unless they has access to your NGROK account (I'm the one who started this problem, because I didn't expect much from this.)
Also, your action page is public, and everyone can access your RDP. Please consider re-forking this repository if you're still using the old codes.
You can contact me on Discord (Kowone#9999) or through email (yie@saikyou.xyz) or just using github repository issue.

Just want you guys to read more about this, this repository is only for educational purposes. Just to make sure about something...

1. I won't be responsible on whatever the hell that happened to your account (example: suspended/terminated) as it's beyond my control on what I can do to limit you guys from doing anything.

2. Just to be sure, kindly don't use this for any other purposes such as hacking, scamming, phishing, mining. Again, I'm not the one at fault if your account got suspended/terminated.

If you're just using this for single instance or something, just set your NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN.
